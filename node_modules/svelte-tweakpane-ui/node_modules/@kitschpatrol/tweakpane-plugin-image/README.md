[![NPM Package @kitschpatrol/tweakpane-plugin-image](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@kitschpatrol/tweakpane-plugin-image.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/@kitschpatrol/tweakpane-plugin-image)

## Overview

**This is a fork of [Florian Morel](http://ayamflow.fr), [Matheus Dias](https://github.com/metehus), and [Palash Bansal](https://github.com/repalash)'s [tweakpane-image-plugin](https://github.com/metehus/tweakpane-image-plugin) with externalized dependencies.**

This allows for smaller bundled file sizes in projects using multiple Tweakpane plugins.

It is published to NPM primarily for the [_Svelte Tweakpane UI_](https://kitschpatrol.com/svelte-tweakpane-ui) project, and will be kept in sync with the upstream version of the plugin, with minimal changes other than dependency externalization.

For most use cases, you probably don't want this fork!

## Background

The [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) configuration provided in the [Tweakpane plugin template](https://github.com/tweakpane/plugin-template) does not externalize [`@tweakpane/core`](https://github.com/cocopon/tweakpane/tree/main/packages/core) as a production dependency.

Instead, it gets built into the single-file plugin artifact, which is what's published to NPM and imported by plugin consumers. This makes it easy to import as an ES module from a URL, but means that larger projects importing multiple Tweakpane plugins end up with duplicate copies of the `@tweakpane/core` code, adding about ~100 Kb to the final minified build for each plugin after the first.

Externalizing this dependency allows build tools like [vite](https://vitejs.dev) to share a single instance of the `@tweakpane/core` code across multiple plugins.

If you're not using a bundler, direct ESM imports from URLs can still work if needed by defining the `@tweakpane/core` dependency in an [importmap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap).

## Implementation notes

The ancestry of this fork is a bit complicated. It's based on [Florian Morel's original work](https://github.com/ayamflow/tweakpane-image-plugin), but merges changes from [Matheus Dias's fork](https://github.com/metehus/tweakpane-image-plugin) and [Palash Bansal's fork](https://github.com/repalash/tweakpane-image-plugin). See the [GitHub network graph](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/tweakpane-plugin-image/network) for some clarity.

I believe Matheus's fork is what's currently published as `tweakpane-image-plugin` on NPM.

Note the package name change from `tweakpane-image-plugin` to `@kitschpatrol/tweakpane-plugin-image` in the sanity-preserving spirit of [hierarchical naming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation).

PNPM is used as the package manager.
